'''Loops in Python: 
Loops in Python are used to repeat actions efficiently. The main types are For loops (counting through items) and While loops (based on conditions). Additionally, Nested Loops allow looping within loops for more complex tasks. While all the ways provide similar basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition-checking time.
