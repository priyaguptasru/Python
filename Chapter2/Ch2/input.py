'''input(): intput function in python is used to take input from the user.
NOTES: the datatype of user's input in input() is always a string type even if the number is entered. Hence we need to convert the type according to our use.
Example:'''
# a=input("Enter value: ")
# print('The value of a is: ', a, ' and the type is :', type(a))
# # b=int(a) #possible when user's input is numeric
# # print('The value of b is: ', b, ' and the type is :', type(b))


# a=input("Enter number 1: ") #user will enter the value
# print(type(a)) #here, type will be str as per the rule of python ie input() will always a string type even if the number is entered.
# b=input("Enter number 2: ") #user will enter the value
# print(type(b)) #here, type will be str as per the rule of python ie input() will always a string type even if the number is entered.
# sum1=a+b #store the concatenate of a and b
# print(sum1) #print concatenate of a and b
# print(type(sum1)) #type will be str only
# sum2=int(a)+int(b) #store the sum of a and b as a and b is converted to int type
# print(sum2) #print sum of a and b
# print(type(sum2)) #type will be int as it store the value of two int values
# c=(a>b) #store the boolean value as comparison operator is applied here
# print(type(a)) #type of a is str only
# print(type(b)) #type of b is str only
# print('Is', a, ' greater than ', b, ':',c)
# print(type(a)) #type of a is str only
# print(type(b)) #type of b is str only
# print(type(c)) #type of c is boolean as it is stored the value of boolean
