'''elif Statement:
elif statement in Python stands for "else if." It allows us to check multiple conditions , providing a way to execute different blocks of code based on which condition is true. Using elif statements makes our code more readable and efficient by eliminating the need for multiple nested if statements.
Note: There can be any number of elif statement in the code.
Example:'''
# age=int(input("Enter age: "))
# if(age<=10):print("Child; not eligible for vote!!!")
# elif(age<=18 and age>=11):print("Teenager; not eligible for vote!!!")
# elif(age<=60 and age>=19):print("Young; eligible for vote!!!")
# else: print("Senior citizen; eligible for vote!!!")
