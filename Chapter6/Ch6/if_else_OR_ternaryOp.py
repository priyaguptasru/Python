'''if-else statement:
It allows us to specify a block of code that will execute if the condition(s) associated with an if or elif statement evaluates to False. Else block provides a way to handle all other cases that don't meet the specified conditions.
Example:'''
# age=int(input("Enter age: "))
# if(age>=18):
#     print("Eligible for vote!!!")
# else:
#     print("Not eligible for vote!!!")


'''The short-hand if-else statement allows you to write a single-line if-else statement.'''
# age=int(input("Enter age: "))
# res = "Eligible for vote!!!" if (age>=18) else "Not eligible for vote!!!"
# print(f"Result: {res}")


# Ternary Operator
'''Note: This method is also known as ternary operator. Ternary Operator essentially a shorthand for the if-else statement that allows us to write more compact and readable code, especially for simple conditions.'''
