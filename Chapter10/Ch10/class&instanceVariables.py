Class and Instance Variables:
In Python, variables defined in a class can be either class variables or instance variables, and understanding the distinction between them is crucial for object-oriented programming.

Class Variables:
These are the variables that are shared across all instances of a class. It is defined at the class level, outside any methods. All objects of the class share the same value for a class variable unless explicitly overridden in an object.

Instance Variables:
Variables that are unique to each instance (object) of a class. These are defined within the __init__ method or other instance methods. Each object maintains its own copy of instance variables, independent of other objects.

#Creating class
class Dog:

    # Class variable
    species = "Canine"

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance variables
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Create objects
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Charlie", 5)

# Access class and instance variables
print(dog1.species)  # (Class variable)
print(dog1.name)     # (Instance variable)
print(dog2.name)     # (Instance variable)

# Modify instance variables
dog1.name = "Max"
print(dog1.name)     # (Updated instance variable)

# Modify class variable
Dog.species = "Feline"
print(dog1.species)  # (Updated class variable)
print(dog2.species)

Explanation:

Class Variable (species): Shared by all instances of the class. Changing Dog.species affects all objects, as itâ€™s a property of the class itself.

Instance Variables (name, age): Defined in the __init__ method. Unique to each instance (e.g., dog1.name and dog2.name are different).

Accessing Variables: Class variables can be accessed via the class name (Dog.species) or an object (dog1.species). Instance variables are accessed via the object (dog1.name).

Updating Variables: Changing Dog.species affects all instances. Changing dog1.name only affects dog1 and does not impact dog2.
