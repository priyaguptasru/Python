Python Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class, restricting access to some components to control interactions.

A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc.

Types of Encapsulation:
Public Members: Accessible from anywhere.
Protected Members: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
Private Members: Accessible only within the class.
