Data Abstraction 
Abstraction hides the internal implementation details while exposing only the necessary functionality. It helps focus on “what to do” rather than “how to do it.”

Types of Abstraction:
Partial Abstraction: Abstract class contains both abstract and concrete methods.
Full Abstraction: Abstract class contains only abstract methods (like interfaces).
